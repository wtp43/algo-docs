# Indexed D-ary Heap

# Implementation

```python

```

## Optimizations

## Optimized Complexity

<CustomCallout type={"Time-Complexity"} title={"Time Complexity"}>Notice that the maximum height for n nodes is $log_kn$Building the heap is still O(n)Swim: $O(log_kn)$Sink: $O(klog_kn)$Swim < Sink</CustomCallout>

<CustomCallout type={"Space-Complexity"} title={"Space Complexity"}>O(n)</CustomCallout>
