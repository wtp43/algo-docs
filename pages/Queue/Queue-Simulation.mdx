# Queues

## Applications

### Simulation Problem

- Use states
- Separate queues if possible (enter pool, leave pool)
- Separate states whenever possible (avoid overlapping states that might be used to store the state of multiple items)
- Iterate the time instead of (separating arrival by state then iterating the queues, keeping track of who has arrived will be difficult)
  - Multiple arrivals are easily managed this way

```python
def timeTaken(self, arrival: List[int], state: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        enter_pool, exit_pool = deque(),deque()
        cur_time = 0
        prev_state = 1
        i = 0
        ans = [0 for _ in range(len(arrival))]
        while i < len(arrival) or enter_pool or exit_pool:
            while i < len(arrival) and arrival[i] <= cur_time:
                if state[i] == 0:
                    enter_pool.append(i)
                else:
                    exit_pool.append(i)
                i += 1
            if prev_state == 1:
                if exit_pool:
                    ans[exit_pool.popleft()] = cur_time
                elif enter_pool:
                    ans[enter_pool.popleft()] = cur_time
                    prev_state = 0
            else:
                if enter_pool:
                    ans[enter_pool.popleft()] = cur_time
                elif exit_pool:
                    ans[exit_pool.popleft()] = cur_time
                    prev_state = 1
                else:
                    prev_state = 1
            cur_time += 1
        return ans
```
