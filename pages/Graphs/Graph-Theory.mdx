# Types of Graphs

## Undirected Graph

- Edges are bidirectional

## Directed Graphs (digraph)

- Edges only point in 1 direction

## Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAG)

- Topological sorting is the most important operation on DAG's

## Weighted Graphs

- Edges contain a certain weight

## Tree

- Undirected graph with no cycles

## Rooted Tree

- Tree with a designated root node
- Arborescence (out-tree) has all edges pointing away from the root
- Anti-arborescence (in-tree) has all edges pointing towards the root
- All out-trees are DAGs but not all DAGs are out-trees

## Bipartite Graph

- All vertices can be split into two independent groups U, V such that every edge connects between U and V
- Two colourable or there is no odd length cycle

## Connected Graph

- Graph in which there is always a path from a vertex to any other vertex

## Complete Graph

- Graph in which there is a unique edge between every pair of nodes
- A complete graph with n vertices is denoted as $K_n$
- Good way to test worst case scenario in an algorithm because of how many edges there are
- ${n \\choose 2}$ = $n(n-1)/2$ edges

## Spanning Tree

- Sub-graph of an undirected connected graph which includes all the vertices of a graph with a minimum possible number of edges. (Must include all vertices)
- Edges may have weights
- $n-1$ edges
- Remove a maximum of e - n + 1 edges from a complete graph to construct a spanning tree

<CustomCallout type={"Note"} title={"Note"}>The total number of spanning trees with `n` vertices that can be created from a complete graph is equal to $n^{(n-2)}$</CustomCallout>

## Minimum Spanning Tree

- Spanning tree in which sum of weight of edges are minimized
- Has no cycles

[Bridges-Algorith](/Graphs/Bridges-Algorithm.mdx)

- A bridge / cut edge is any edge in a graph whose removal increases the number of connected components
- Often important in graph theory because they hint at weak points, bottlenecks or vulnerabilities in a graph

## Articulation Point

- An articulation point / cut vertex is a node in a graph whose removal increases the number of connected components
